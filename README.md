# restTemplate
A full rest example.

To run the rest server, go to 'restInterface' and run the main class.  You can pass the host IP if needed.
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="name.hampton.mike.Main" -Dexec.args="192.168.0.51"

To test the interface, use a est client to test "http://localhost:8080/myapp/myresource" (or whatever the IP is)

To see the definition of services, look at "http://localhost:8080/myapp/application.wadl"
